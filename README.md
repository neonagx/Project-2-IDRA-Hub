# Project 2: IDRA Hub

###By Sukhyun (Paul) Baik

##About IDRA Hub

IDRA is a full CRUD application site where Droners post any drone related product, whether it is fully built drones or parts, on the site. User will be able to create their own account with unique password in order to login.  Only one user can delete or update his or her own post.
